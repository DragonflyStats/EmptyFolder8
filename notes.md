## complex Numbers

## Exponential functions

## First Order Seperable Differential Equations

 * Re-arrange equation 
 * Integrate both sides
 * Don't forget coefficients of integration (i.e. the "+c" bit )



First Order Differential Equations


Second Order Differential Equations


 * Integration Factor $\mu$
 * Homogeneous Equations (Using inital conditions)

Example 
\[ y^{\prime \prime } + 6 y^{ \prime }  + 8y = 0 \]


## Critical Points of a function

You should have 5 parts to your answer

- $\partial(f) / \partial(x) $
- $\partial(f) / \partial(y) $
- $\partial(f) / \partial(x) $
- $\partial(f) / \partial(y) $
- $\partial(f) / \partial(x) $

## Lagrange Multipliers

## Fourier series

 * Period Functions

\[ f(t) = f(t +p) \]
